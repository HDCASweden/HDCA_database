A first clustering and differential expression analysis of 163236, high-quality cDNA libraries revealed six main cell-categories: the mesoderm-derived (i) mesenchymal, (ii) endothelial, (iii) immune cells and (iv) erythroblasts/erythrocytes (RBC), (v) the ectoderm-derived neuronal and (vi) the endoderm-derived epithelial cells. Then, we individually analyzed these major categories to identify an unexpectedly high heterogeneity of 83 cell-states. The tabs below show the UMAP-plot of all analyzed cells, in addition to those of endothelial, epithelial, immune, mesenchymal and neuronal datasets. The users can project the annotated cell-types and states, in addition to categorical (e.g., donor, chemistry and gender) and numerical (e.g., number of detected genes and age) metadata information. They can also visualize the expression levels of the top 5000 variable genes. "
